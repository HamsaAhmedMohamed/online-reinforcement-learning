# Online and Reinforcement Learning -- Course Repository

This repository contains my **notes, implementations, and experiments**
from the\
**Online and Reinforcement Learning** course at the **University of
Copenhagen (KU)**.

The focus of this course and repository is to build a strong foundation
in:

-   Regret minimization and online learning theory\
-   Multi‑armed bandits and exploration--exploitation trade‑offs\
-   Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)\
-   Temporal‑difference learning and policy optimization\
-   Deep Reinforcement Learning methods\
-   Practical Python implementations and experiments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals of this Repository

-   Develop **deep theoretical understanding** of reinforcement and
    online learning\
-   Translate **mathematical concepts into working code**\
-   Build a **portfolio of clear, reproducible ML experiments**\
-   Prepare for **advanced AI engineering and research work**
